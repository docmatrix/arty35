Introduction
===

This is a collection of notes and examples for programming a
[Diligent Arty35](https://store.digilentinc.com/arty-a7-artix-7-fpga-development-board-for-makers-and-hobbyists/).

It starts with the [Music Box tutorials](https://www.fpga4fun.com/MusicBox1.html)
from fpga4fun.com (1_simple_beep -> 3_music), and then builds on those ideas by
producing a basic additive synthesizer (4_synth -> 8_synth).

All of the code here assumes you have a [PMOD AMP2](https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-amp2-audio-amplifier/)
plugged into the top row of pins of the JD header.
